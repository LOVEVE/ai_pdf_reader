# PyPDF2 can decrypt AES-encrypted PDFs if either pyca/cryptography
# or pycryptodome is installed.  Without an AES backend, attempting
# to parse a protected document results in a `DependencyError` like
# "PyCryptodome is required for AES algorithm".  Installing
# pycryptodome satisfies this optional dependency and allows the app
# to handle encrypted PDFs【27142413809168†L86-L92】.  If you prefer
# cryptography, replace this line with `cryptography>=41.0.0`.
